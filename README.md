# Indian Legal Chatbot

## Overview
This project fine-tunes the [DeepSeek R1](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/deepseek-llm) model using the [UnslopT](https://github.com/UnslopT/unslopt) framework on the [Indian Legal Texts dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshatgupta7/llm-fine-tuning-dataset-of-indian-legal-texts). The goal is to develop an AI-powered chatbot capable of answering legal queries specific to Indian law.

## Dataset
The dataset used for fine-tuning consists of Indian Penal Code (IPC) legal texts and QA pairs sourced from Kaggle. This dataset helps the chatbot understand and provide relevant legal insights based on Indian jurisdiction.
